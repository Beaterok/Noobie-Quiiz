# Noobie Quiz
## Description

Provide a short description:
 My motivation to create a simple quiz website that can store scores and display them from local storage. Each question is being rendered with multiple choice options to select, and it also displays if you got the question right or wrong. I wanted to learn how to code the logic elements from scratch in JS. I learned how to attach the functions to specific buttons and how change the items displayed.
